## Apex Labs Homework - Movie Site with React


_Functional requirements:_
- Have a movie title search box on the UI, on enter/click of a button it requests the search results from our graphql sandbox for TMDB: https://tmdb.sandbox.zoosh.ie/dev/grphql

- It displays the results and some of their data (name, category, score) in a list, titles can be clicked

- By clicking on an address, the app tries to find the related English wikipedia page (with a REST request) and then displays a summary of it in a detail panel (e.g. first paragraph), along with a clickable link that opens in a new window in IMDB and wikipedia

- Bonus: Dual state search engine; a “related” button next to the two links in the movie: this switches the movie list from search results to a list of related movies related to the selected movie

_Levels:_
+ A working web page
+ Spinner while loading data from TMDBW or wikipedia
+ Search for related movies
+ Bonus # 1: Use Material-UI library, Material-UI look
+ Bonus # 2: Tests


It can also be a little bigger bite, we leave it up to you how far you want to go with it and whether you also deal with bonus tasks. Obviously, a junior can solve less, while a senior more in a period of time, but what interests us the most is the quality of the code itself that is born in that time.
